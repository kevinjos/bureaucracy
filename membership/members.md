Being a Member of Noisebridge is not like being a regular Member. Lots of folks come to Noisebridge to hack and learn: you don't need to be a Member. At Noisebridge, membership is something more: it means taking responsibility and committing to help to maintain, improve, and govern Noisebridge. As a Member of Noisebridge, you don't just come here to hack and learn, you actively work to improve what you see around you, help to deal with problems, and make this community better than it is today.

Appplication
============

Noisebridge Members are the only folks in our community who are empowered to fully participate in Noisebridge's consensus process. (Associate Members may participate in discussion, but may not block consensus.)  This is a heady and awesome responsibility, and it is likewise an involved process to become a member. Here's how it goes:

1. Fill out top part of an application form. There should be blank forms in the Membership Binder, or you can print your own. (If you don't know where the membership binder is, ask a member!)
2. Put your completed application form in the binder at the space.
3. Persuade two current full Noisebridge members to sponsor your application by signing your application form.
4. Every meeting, there is a standing agenda item to read all the applications in the binder. You do not have to be present when your application is read.
5. Once your application has been read out at four meetings, and you have obtained two sponsors, you are up for approval.
6. During that meeting you may request that Noisebridge consents to have you become a Member, but you may put this off until the next meeting (or the next &c.). If you are unable to attend meetings, another Member may proxy your request.
7. During the meeting at which you request that Noisebridge consents to have you become a Member, those present may ask you (or your proxy) questions.
8. After those present are finished asking questions, you are asked to leave the room, and your application is discussed without you present. The meeting may then choose to agree to have you become a Member of Noisebridge. 

If you leave your paper membership application form in the binder for more than twelve weeks, it will be discarded. If you still want to become a Member, you'll have to start the application process over from scratch. 

Once Noisebridge has agreed to have you as a member you have one important thing to do:

* Fill out your contact information and give the Secretary your application form.

At the very least, the secretary needs your email address. A noisebridge.net wiki username is also customary.

Other useful information includes the following.

* IRC nickname
* Github username
* Twitter handle
* GPG fingerprint

Once you have done both these things, you are entitled to full participation in Noisebridge's consensus process.

At any time, anyone can look in the binder and peruse the applications. If an existing Member has any concerns with any of the applicants, they should take time during that month to try and resolve the problem. They may ask another Member to be a proxy for them to either help resolve the problem (preferred) or to voice their objection at the approval meeting.

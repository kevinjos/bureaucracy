Departure
=========

Associate members can leave Noisebridge. If an associate member wants to leave, they just need to delete the attestations and the category from their wiki user page. You can also delete your wiki account, but you don't have to. If a Member wishes to leave, they should inform the secretary.

In either case, once you leave, you need to go through the whole joining process to become an associate member again. Your sponsors can be the same, but they need to add their comments to your user page; you can't just copy and paste their previous attestations.


Suspension
==========

Noisebridge may suspend any form of membership. A Member is not entitled to full participation in the consensus process around a proposal to suspend that person's Membership. If a member of any kind has been suspended, they shall no longer be considered a part of Noisebridge for any purpose, including but not limited to, participation in the consensus process. 


Hiatus
======

(For the rest of this document, assume "member" refers to both associate members and Members.)

Noisebridge allows members to go on hiatus if they wish to temporarily suspend their membership. Hiatus may be used when a member will not be involved in Noisebridge for an extended period, such as if they are traveling.

Members on hiatus are not entitled to full participation in Noisebridge's consensus process.

Going on hiatus
---------------

If a member wishes to go on hiatus, they should do the following:

* Notify the secretary that they are going on hiatus and specify the date on which they intend to return.

If a member going on hiatus will not have regular internet acces or has specific communication needs during their hiatus period, it is their responsibility to arrange this with the secretary before they go on hiatus. 

While on hiatus (termination)
-----------------------------

* A member of any kind may extend their term of hiatus at any time by contacting the secretary.
* If a member on hiatus does not contact the treasurer and secretary within three months from the date on which they intended to return, their membership shall expire. If that person wants to rejoin Noisebridge, they must go through the joining process again.
* If a member did not specify an exact time at which they intend to return from hiatus, their membership shall expire four months after they initially went on hiatus. If that person wants to rejoin Noisebridge, they must go through the joining process again. 

Returning from hiatus
---------------------

To return from hiatus, a member must notify the secretary that they have returned. Associate members' status returns as soon as these two tasks are complete.  Full participation in the consensus process for Members returns one calendar month after this task is complete.

There are two categories of members at Noisebridge: [associate members](./associate_members.md) and the [Members](./members.md). 

It is the responsibility of all participants at Noisebridge (guests, associate members, and Members) to contribute to Noisebridge as they are able. An individual's contribution should be proportionate with that person's use of Noisebridge and its resources. A reasonable monetary contribution from a Member or associate member may be $80 per month, but it is each person's responsibility to determine what contribution is reasonable for them.

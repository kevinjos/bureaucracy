Application
=========

These are the steps to become a member of Noisebridge.

1. Make an account on the [Noisebridge wiki](https://noisebridge.net/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup).
2. Edit your wiki user page to add as much or as little description as you like.
3. Optionally, add `[[Category:Applicants]]` to your user page.

Then, four sponsors add a note of support to your wiki user page. Any council member may sponsor you. Any member who has been a member since the most recent Tuesday meeting may also sponsor you. Someone who edits your user page to sponsor you must be logged in when making the edit.

Once there are four notes of support on your wiki user page, add `[[Category:Members]]` to your user page. If you used `[[Category:Applicants]]`, remove that.

As soon as you have added the category `[[Category:Members]]`, you are a Noisebridge member.

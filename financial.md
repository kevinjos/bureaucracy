The following are consensus decisions regarding Noisebridge's finances.

General
=======

Noisebridge's primary accounts should be held with a local credit union such as the San Francisco Fire Credit Union. Other accounts should be deprecated and eventually closed when no longer in use.

Noisebridge's Treasurer may grant power of attorney to an accountant who prepares our taxes.


Authorizations

Special
